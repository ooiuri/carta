# The Letter!

Hi! This project is about a eletronic letter made in p5.js that you can send to anyone that is **important to you.**
Actually, this is my first project using p5.js and sharing at github. I'd like to hear any suggestion or observation that could make this better. I wish good moments to you all! 

# Installation
The project runs in p5.js, so you are going to need a local server to host this program (that is the only way that I know yet), to create the local server, follow the steps on the link below:
[ Node http-server](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server#node-http-server-2nd-option)

# to edit
If you wanna use this code, you will have to surf a little on the files, promise that I'll improve the edit

**thanks to you all**
